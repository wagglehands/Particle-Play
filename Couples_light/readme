## OVERVIEW
This project includes two Particle Argon IoT devices. The goal of this project is 
to achieve communication via LEDs that light up to heart beat pulses and can send s
ignals over any distance. The only requirement is that both of the Particle Argon IOT 
devices must be connected to WIFI so the signal is sent successfully. When the button 
is pressed on an Argon, three LEDs flash and when the heartbeat sensor is held, LED 
connected to D6 flashes. This can be configured to use any colored LED without needing 
to code anything. If more or less LEDs are wanted that can be configured with a simple 
addition of another LED into a code. The time delay between the LEDs lighting up can 
also be configured simply in the code.

## WIRING
The Button is connected to ground, positive and D4, the LED's are connected to D6, D5, 
and D3 and also to the ground strip. The heart beat sensor is connected to positive, 
ground, and A1. There is also a couple jumper wires going from 3v3 to positive strip 
and ground to the negative strip. The both of the ground strips are being powered by 
a jumper wire.
